# GitHub Release Instructions for Large Model File

## Step 1: Create a GitHub Release

1. **Go to your GitHub repository:**
   https://github.com/AKSHAT-ARORA03/PAWDENTIFY-AI-Powered-Dog-Breed-Recognition-System

2. **Click "Releases" (on the right side of the main page)**

3. **Click "Create a new release"**

4. **Fill in the release details:**
   - **Tag version**: `v1.0`
   - **Release title**: `Pawdentify v1.0 - AI Model Release`
   - **Description**:
     ```
     # Pawdentify AI Model v1.0
     
     This release contains the trained EfficientNetV2 model for dog breed recognition.
     
     ## Model Details
     - **File**: final_model.keras
     - **Size**: 119MB
     - **Architecture**: EfficientNetV2
     - **Classes**: 120 dog breeds

     ## Usage
     Download the model file and place it in the `model/` directory of your project.
     The backend will automatically download this file during deployment.
     ```

5. **Upload the model file:**
   - Drag and drop your `final_model.keras` file into the "Attach binaries" section
   - GitHub allows files up to 2GB in releases!

6. **Click "Publish release"**

## Step 2: Update Model Downloader

After creating the release, update the model_downloader.py file:

```python
# Replace this URL in model_downloader.py
model_urls = [
    "https://github.com/AKSHAT-ARORA03/PAWDENTIFY-AI-Powered-Dog-Breed-Recognition-System/releases/download/v1.0/final_model.keras",
]
```

## Step 3: Test Deployment

The backend will now automatically download the model during startup on Render!
