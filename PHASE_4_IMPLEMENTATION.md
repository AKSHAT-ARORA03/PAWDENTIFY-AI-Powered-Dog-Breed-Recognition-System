}

const searchBreeds = (query, filters) => {
  return Object.entries(ENHANCED_BREED_DATABASE)
    .map(([name, breed]) => ({
      ...breed,
      name,
      score: calculateBreedScore(query, breed, filters)
    }))
    .filter(breed => breed.score > 0.1)
    .sort((a, b) => b.score - a.score)
}
```

    <div className="bg-gradient-to-r from-green-50 to-emerald-50">
      <h4>Health Overview</h4>
      <StarRating rating={breed.healthRating} />
    </div>
    
    {/* Common health issues */}
    <div className="grid gap-3">
      {breed.health.commonIssues.map(issue => (
        <HealthIssueCard key={issue} issue={issue} />
      ))}
    </div>
