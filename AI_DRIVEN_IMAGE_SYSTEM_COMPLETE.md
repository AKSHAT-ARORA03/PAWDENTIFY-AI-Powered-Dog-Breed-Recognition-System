## 🔧 **Configuration & Usage**

### **Environment Setup**
Add to `frontend/.env`:
```env
VITE_UNSPLASH_ACCESS_KEY=your-unsplash-key-here
```

### **Service Integration**
The system is automatically initialized when Care Guides loads:
```javascript
import enhancedImageService from './services/enhancedImageService'
import predictionService from './services/predictionService'
```

### **Backward Compatibility**
Existing code continues to work:
```javascript
// This now uses AI-driven images automatically
const images = await getBreedImages(breedName, 'medium', 6)
```

---

## 🎉 **Result**

Your Care Guides now display **authentic, breed-specific dog photos** that are:
- ✅ **Dynamically sourced** from your AI model's exact breed classifications
- ✅ **Automatically fetched** from external APIs with no manual management
- ✅ **Intelligently cached** for optimal performance
- ✅ **Quality validated** to ensure breed accuracy
- ✅ **Seamlessly integrated** with your existing UI components

The static placeholder image problem is **completely solved** with a professional, scalable, AI-driven solution that enhances the educational value of your Care Guides while maintaining excellent performance! 🐕✨
